Collection of ESPHome YAML definitions for various boards and dev kits

This repository is where I share reusable ESPHome YAML definitions for various boards and dev kits I acquire, to make it easier for other to use those boards.

My board definition are clean, only define the hardware. That allows you to focus on the application logic. This separation of hardware and application makes the code reusable and composable.
